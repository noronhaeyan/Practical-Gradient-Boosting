    "Training multiple models over the range of hyper-parameter values can be time consuming even with parallelization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized algorithms for hyper-parameter search exist and may provide satisfactory results at low computation cost, e.g. RandomizedSearchCV and HalvingRandomSerachCV in scikit-learn. Nevertheless, we can still miss out on a better configuration for the model.\n",

    "Surrogate models allow optimal hyper-parameter search in a non-exhaustive way, guiding the search towards more promising candidates.\n",

    "In this notebook, we train an XGBoost model to predict a model score associated to a hyper-parameter value. This way, we do not have to run a complete trining to calculate model score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general algorithm can be summarized as follows: n configurations are randomly drawn. The surrogate model performs a gain estimation for each one. the most promising configuration is then actually tested on the model to be trained. the gain obtained is reused to enrich the urrogate model.\n",

    "As a case study, we apply the hyper-parameter model to the Boston dataset and compare results."
